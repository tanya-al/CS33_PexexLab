First, I turned logging on for gdb.
I ran gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-24.5.
I set a breakpoint at Ftimes using "b Ftimes".
I created the following macro.
	define a
		stepi
		info reg
	end
I "set disassemble-next-line on" to automatically dissasemble everything as I stepped through.
Finally, I "run -batch -eval '(print (* 6997 -4398042316799 179))'" on gdb.
I stepped through Ftimes and arith_driver, recording every instruction as specified in the lab spec (addresses, instruction, and what registers/memory addresses were altered). Once Ftimes returned, I used the continue call to run the rest of the execution.
